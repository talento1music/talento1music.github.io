            <p style="text-align:justify">
              Germán Montero was born on May 21, 1979, in Los Mochis, Sinaloa. His childhood was full of love, because his family always supported him in everything he undertook because despite being very humble they had the privilege of being very close. 
              <br><br>
              In his childhood he worked selling street pallets and chewing gum in trucks and when he was a little older, he started selling American chocolates in some offices, improving his economy. However, despite his efforts to study, he could not conclude the international business career as he would have liked. 
              <br><br>
              Since he was young he discovered the right one for the band music and the first opportunity is presented with a neighbor animator of bands, who invites him for the first time, to be the main voice of the "Banda Parranda", later he joins the "Banda" puro Sinaloa ", managing to place itself favorably in the public's taste. Then he was invited to be a member of the "Banda San Martín". 
              <br><br>
              It was in the year 2001 when he took a step in his artistic career joining René Camacho's "Arrolladora Banda el limón", having great success in the middle of the group and belonging to it for six years, earning the love and recognition of the national public and international, and thus paying the price of success came to sacrifice time with his family. Reason that led him to leave the group. 
              <br><br>
              On October 19, 2007 he formed his first band as a soloist, having in his hands his first album "Pensando en ti", which included the greatest hits such as: "Amantes escondidos", "What separates us", "Oh that drunk ", And of course" Pensando en ti ", themes with which manages to win the eyes of entrepreneurs, programmers and the general public. That same year he receives his first gold record for more than 70 thousand copies sold.
              <br><br>
              Almost 10 years of his solo career he has had great achievements such as the duet with Luis Fonsi, sharing the stage with Vicente Fernández, singing for the first time with Banda el Recodo, winner of the 2008 Oye Award as a soloist for his album "Pensando en ti", participated in the 50 most beautiful faces of PEOPLE in Spanish 2009, the release of his record material "Compréndeme" from which he obtained his second album of gold for more than 60 thousand copies sold less than a month after its release on the market. In that same year he obtained nominations for the Billboard awards in two categories: Song of the year debut and Mexican regional theme, airplay of the year with the single "Amantes escondidos", and Latin Grammy as album of the year. 
              <br><br>
              In 2010 he made his debut as an actor in a Mexican film: "La traición de un hijo". He participated in a dance contest reaching the semifinals, surprising his audience with these stages. That same year he launched his own tequila "REY MOMO", where he participated as an entrepreneur and official image of the brand; He also merges as a co-author with great artists such as Samo, Jesus Navarro, Noel Schajris, Amauri Gutierrez, Reyli Barba, the Ha-ash, Claudia Brant and Mane de la Parra, adding to this the launch of their own clothing line and the concept album titled "Te acordarás". 
              <br><br>
              In 2011 he is recognized with two stars for his artistic career and releases his album "Por lo imposible", from which the themes "No pasa nada", "Esos tus ojos" and "Obsesionado" are released. First places of popularity nationwide.
              <br><br>
              Later and again, he managed to place in the first places topics such as "Infiel", "Aún sigo amándote" and "En realidad mis fantasías", besides being invited in a special way to sing in the National Auditorium with Jorge Muñiz and the tribute José José, representing the Mexican regional genre. Then he incorporated the release of his discography "Me  seguirás buscando" where the songs "Yo te vi" and "Quién eres tú" were his biggest successes. On October 30, 2016, he released his discography "El Cantante", which was released at the Latin Monitor Convention; but a month before, he released the first single "De tanto amarte" following his second single titled "La Pijama" which is quickly entered into radio, television and digital media. Germán continues to demonstrate that he knows how to venture as a singer-author, launching in September 2017 his eleventh discography entitled: " Por  puro  gusto.  Vol.1 ", from which his first single" No estabas en mis planes ", the subject of his authorship, is very successful.
              <br><br>
              Even with all that, Germán Montero seeks to transcend the public beyond music willing to show his more human side with a conference entitled " Un, dos, tres por mí. Y tú, ¿ya te encontraste? "
